## Overview
The Skill Circle Library Management System is a simple interactive text-based program developed in Python that allows users to explore a collection of self-improvement books. The system presents detailed information about each book, including its name, author, description, launch date, and price. The user can choose a book from the list, view its details, and then decide whether to continue exploring more books or exit the system.

## Features

The user is presented with a menu of available books and can choose a book by entering its corresponding number.
### Detailed Information: 
Once a book is selected, the system displays detailed information, including:
- Book name
- Author
- Launch date
- Description
- Price
### Continue or Exit: 
After viewing the book details, the user can either:
- Press 1 to continue exploring other books.
- Press 2 to exit the system.
The program ensures a smooth, user-friendly experience with easy navigation between different books.

## How to Use
### 1. Start the Program: 
When the program starts, it will greet the user and display a menu with available books.
