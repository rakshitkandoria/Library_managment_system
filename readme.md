# Skill Circle Library Management System
## Overview
The Skill Circle Library Management System is a simple interactive text-based program developed in Python that allows users to explore a collection of self-improvement books. The system presents detailed information about each book, including its name, author, description, launch date, and price. The user can choose a book from the list, view its details, and then decide whether to continue exploring more books or exit the system.

## Features
### Book Selection: 
The user is presented with a menu of available books and can choose a book by entering its corresponding number.
### Detailed Information: 
Once a book is selected, the system displays detailed information, including:
- Book name
- Author
- Launch date
- Description
- Price
### Continue or Exit: 
After viewing the book details, the user can either:
- Press 1 to continue exploring other books.
- Press 2 to exit the system.
The program ensures a smooth, user-friendly experience with easy navigation between different books.

## How to Use
### 1. Start the Program: 
When the program starts, it will greet the user and display a menu with available books.
### 2. Select a Book: 
The user can select a book by entering a number corresponding to the book from the menu.
### 3. View Book Details: 
After selecting a book, detailed information about that book will be displayed, including:
- Book name
- Author
- Launch date
- Description
- Price
### Continue or Exit:
After viewing the details of a book, the user can choose to:
- Continue by pressing 1 to view more books.
- Exit by pressing 2, which will end the session.
## Example Workflow
Here’s an example of how the program flows:

The program greets the user and shows the list of books.
The user selects a book, for example, by entering 1 for the first book.
The program displays details about the selected book.
The user is asked if they want to continue or exit.
If the user selects continue, they can pick another book.
If the user selects exit, the program will end.
